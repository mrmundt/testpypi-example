# TestPyPi: How-To and Example## What is Test PyPi?TestPyPI is a separate instance of the Python Package Index (PyPI) that allows you to try out the distribution tools and process without worrying about affecting the real index. TestPyPI is hosted at https://test.pypi.org.## How do you use it?The setup for TestPyPi is exactly the same as uploading to PyPi. After creating the package files, `setup.py` file, a `README`, `LICENSE`, and all other files necessary for your Python package:### Generate the distribution archivesFirst, install `setuptools` and `wheel`:```$ pip install setuptools wheel```Next, create the wheel:```$ python setup.py sdist --format=gztar bdist_wheel```Other options are available such as `register`, `--with-cython`, etc.This command will place the source archive (tarball) and the built distribution (wheel) in the `dist/` directory. ### Upload the distribution archivesInstall `twine`:```$ pip install twine```To upload to TestPyPi, run this command:```$ twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*```### Download the distribution archivesTo download and install your test, run this command:```pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ your-package-name```## ExampleThis repository has an example Python package that does nothing but take a list or tuple of words and print them individually. Try these commands:```$ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel$ twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*$ pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ TestPyPi-Sample-Package-mmundt```
